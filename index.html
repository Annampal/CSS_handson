        <li><span class="del">Css is not necessary-</span><span class="gold">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>

    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be addded to html document in 3 ways: </h2>
    <ul class="Section2">
        <li class="font">internal by using a style attribute inside html elements! </li>
        <li class="font">External by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li class="font">THe most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,<span class="gold">in this titirial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>

    </ul><br>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that css class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript</p><br>
    <p>in CSS, selector are used to target a specific element ot range of element on web page. Once on element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element</p>
